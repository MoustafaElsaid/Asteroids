# Asteroids
- This is my first attempt at building a game using `pygame` python library...
- I have decided to abandon this project, since I do not identify with this game. I don't like the fact that I have to copy and paste code that I don't understand in order to learn OOP. 
- I believe there are many better example projects that would help me understand and learn OOP than to build such a game.[^1: This is a foot-note attempt]
